See https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix how to use the led matrix and how to compile.
If you are able to reproduce the examples there, copy the source from this repository into the
main directory of rpi-rgb-led-matrix.

For building use ./my_make.sh <file>, without the file ending, e.g. ./my_make.sh mandelbrot. Run it via sudo ./mandelbrot.

For pngs, png++ needs to be installed. If I remember correctly I built it from source.
