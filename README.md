# Led-matrix
See https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix how to use the led-matrix and how to compile.
If you are able to reproduce the examples there, copy the source from this repository into the
main directory of rpi-rgb-led-matrix.

For wiring the led-matrix see 32x32_matrix_wiring.png.

For building use `./my_make.sh <file>`, without the file ending, e.g. `./my_make.sh mandelbrot`. Run it via `sudo ./mandelbrot`.

For pngs, png++ needs to be installed. If I remember correctly I built it from source.

Make also sure that paths are set correctly.

# Gps
## Requirements
1. Raspberry pi model B
2. NAVILOCK GPS NL-602U USB at usb-port closest to the raspi
3. Libraries: gpsd, gpsd-client, python-gps

## Description
1. First cronjob starts a bash-script which starts gpsd at boot up: **gps.sh**.
2. Second cronjob starts a bash-script which runs a python-script read√≠ng out the wanted gps-data and saves it to file:
   1. **gpsspeed.sh** and **gpsspeed.py** save in **speed.txt**;
   2. **gpstime.sh** and **gpstime.py** save in **time.txt**.
3. Optional: Third cronjob starts the led-binary which reads out file containing the gps-data.
4. It might take some time until the NAVILOCK finds the gps signal. Won't work well in a closed room.

Found no other, more elegant way to get speed or time from gps.

## Install libraries
`sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-client python-gps`

## Configure gpsd so that it is not started automatically
`sudo dpkg-reconfigure gpsd`

This is my configuration and might be unnecessary together with the corresponding cronjob (see below).

## Edit cronjobs via
`sudo crontab -e`

## Add the following lines to cronjobs (change &lt;path&gt; correspondingly)
`@reboot cd /home/pi/<path>/rpi-rgb-led-matrix; ./gps.sh &`

`@reboot cd /home/pi/<path>/rpi-rgb-led-matrix; ./gpsspeed.sh &`

The last command creates and updates /home/pi/&lt;path&gt;/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/speed.txt. Then reboot:
`sudo shutdown -r reboot`

## See gps.cc for an example
Compile via `./my_make.sh gps`.
